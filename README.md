# Introduction
Hi, I hope you find this script useful.

#######This script can
1. Connect to a remote server
2. Connect to a PostgreSQL Server & export the preferred schema
3. Download the exported [schema].[DATE].sql to your computer
4. Delete the [schema] from your local PostgreSQL Server
5. Import the freshly downloaded [schema].[DATE].sql file to that schema

1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
⋅⋅* Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
⋅⋅1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

### How to use
The script should have execute permissions in order to be executable:
```
chmod u+x getjets.sh
```
Then simply run it by calling:
```
./getjets.sh
```
